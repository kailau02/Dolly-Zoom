# Dolly-Zoom
I've always been amazed by the gradual perspective change of dolly zoom, and I have some experience in python and OpenCV, so I decided to create an AI dolly zoom.
The python script detects a face and draws a box around the closest face to the camera. Then, through a few chucks of geometric equations, the window zooms into the users face.
